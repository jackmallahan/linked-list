IdeaBox

Idea box is the second paired project assigned in Mod 1 FE.  This application is designed to store thoughts and ideas.  The user is prompted with two input fields near the top of the page.  The first for an idea title and the second as the body to enter notes about the idea.  The inputs are followed by a save button which once clicked will generate an "idea card" that is added to the lower half of the page and also sending a unique object to local storage.  Once the user has generated the idea card they have the ability to edit the original info stored by simply clicking in either the heading or body areas to manipulate the text.  The user can delete the card from the section by clicking the delete button which also removes it from local storage permanently.  Located at the bottom of each card is a up and down vote button which allows the user the ability to change give the idea car three different qualities of "swill". "plausible", and "genius".  These qualities are also stored in local storage until deleted.
